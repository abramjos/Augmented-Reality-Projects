## [Project 1](https://youtu.be/kDU60k2nmZE) : Tracked targets with associated virtual objects 
  The entire project folder is available [here](https://knightsucfedu39751-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/abraham_knights_ucf_edu/ET2N97ug1zlGotagsdzu20MBFUmoAC7IWBaO-zlB4y5ogQ?e=QlFUD1)
  Using Vuforia to track objects for associated objects with animation and video/audio objects.  
  
## [Project 2](https://youtu.be/0wdjKYXTQg4) : Tracked targets with associated phantom objects
  The entire project folder is available [here](https://knightsucfedu39751-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/abraham_knights_ucf_edu/Eb2PY236gphCqW5UaeVIVl4BIfLMkDBZd4eoPDJTRsUIrg?e=A6i6cD)
  Using a phnatom object to the associated targets. 
  
## [Project 3](https://youtu.be/Z6gzAvy2kIk) : Tracked targets with situated visualization.
  The entire project folder is available [here](https://knightsucfedu39751-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/abraham_knights_ucf_edu/EQFiqqEMzatOijTAhA82Q8gBClhOHUK26m5xsxZE5ZS1Pg?e=rawHmT)
  Using situated visualization on 4 tragets for:
  1) labeling the target object.
  2) Using vuforia virtual botton for sharing information. 
  3) Using magnifier and culling to create situated visalizution. 
  
## [Project 4](https://youtu.be/rph7C3iF5cE) : Tracked targets with instances of tangible operations.
  The entire project folder is available [here](https://knightsucfedu39751-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/abraham_knights_ucf_edu/EfzOF0642HBJnISj1L9Lr9YBYnyS3Qccqnb2FSdPdm-ycg?e=MRceAc)
  Using tangible operations based on angles and distances between mutiple target instances for:
  1) Color picker using 2 target objects.
  2) Using the color picker for updating the color of augmented object using tangible operations and virtual button.
  
## [Project 5](https://youtu.be/kNjrpthOGqI) : Tracked target with instances of navigational aids.
  The entire project folder is available [here](https://knightsucfedu39751-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/abraham_knights_ucf_edu/EVdR4e-pfThNhPGINvBkJXoBr9BAAQ9uUhaXh-DNLZYUUA?e=3AcROi)
  Navigational Aids includes:
  1) Viewpoint Guidance using tunneling cue.
  2) Using compass and guidance to find instances of target objects.
 
## [Project 6](https://youtu.be/mic8gq4FZ70) : Tracked targets with non-tangible, collaborative features.
  The entire project folder is available [here](https://knightsucfedu39751-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/abraham_knights_ucf_edu/EdRgIPJK1fFEmSNKd2afjDQBGNfN8lq3HKG56-zf4r5gkg?e=Ry8VxI)  
  Collabrative feature using PUN2 and non-tangible object was created using miniature world. A 2D map also rendered for the user navigational aid.
